    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: June 18, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>At Touch Theory, accessible at <a href="https://thetouchtheory.github.io/">https://thetouchtheory.github.io/</a>, we prioritize your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information related to your use of our website. As an affiliate site, we do not collect personal data directly, but our third-party partners may. Please read this policy to understand our practices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Touch Theory does not collect or store personal information (e.g., names, email addresses, or IP addresses) from visitors. However, we use affiliate links to third-party websites (SiliconWives, SpartanLover, Lovense), which may collect data when you interact with their services. We also may use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to track non-personal data, such as page views, to improve our site.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Affiliate Links</strong>: Clicking our affiliate links may lead to data collection by third-party sites. Their privacy policies govern such data.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: If implemented, tools like Google Analytics may collect anonymous data (e.g., browser type, visit duration) via cookies. See our Cookie Policy (if applicable) for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not use or share it. Non-personal analytics data, if collected, is used to enhance site performance and user experience. Third-party partners may use data per their privacy policies, linked below:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.siliconwives.com/pages/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SiliconWives Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://spartanlover.com/pages/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SpartanLover Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.lovense.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovense Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Touch Theory earns commissions from qualifying purchases made through affiliate links to SiliconWives, SpartanLover, and Lovense. This does not affect your purchase price but supports our site’s operations.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Our site may use cookies for analytics or affiliate tracking. You can manage cookie preferences via your browser settings. If we use cookies, we’ll provide a cookie consent banner to comply with laws like GDPR and CCPA.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not process data subject requests (e.g., data deletion). For data collected by third parties, contact them directly using their privacy policies. Under GDPR, CCPA, or other laws, you may have rights to access, delete, or opt out of data processing by those parties.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>Our site links to external websites not controlled by Touch Theory. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Review their policies before sharing personal information.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We do not store personal data, so no data breach risks exist on our end. Third-party partners are responsible for securing their data per their policies.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date. Check back regularly for updates.</p>
